# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for a minimalist, fast, and keyboard-driven Linux setup.

These configuration files are tailored for a Wayland-based system using **Hyprland**, with lightweight tools like **Waybar**, **Wofi**, and terminal-based utilities such as **Kitty**, **Neofetch**, and **htop**.
